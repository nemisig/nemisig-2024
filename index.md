## About Ithaca and Ithaca College

[Ithaca, New York,](https://www.visitithaca.com/) is a small city known for its scenic beauty, vibrant cultural scene, and academic atmosphere, largely influenced by [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) and [Ithaca College](https://www.ithaca.edu/). Situated in the Finger Lakes region, it's renowned for its natural attractions, including gorges, waterfalls, and Cayuga Lake. The downtown area, centered around the [Ithaca Commons](https://www.downtownithaca.com/visit-downtown/the-commons/), is a hub for local shops, restaurants, and arts venues. Ithaca also has a strong community focus on sustainability and progressive politics. 

[Ithaca College](https://www.ithaca.edu/) is a private college known for its strong programs in communications, music, and the liberal arts. Established in 1892, it emphasizes a blend of theory and practice in its curriculum. Its picturesque campus overlooks Cayuga Lake and offers a vibrant college town environment, while its alumni network is particularly strong in the media and entertainment industries.

## Travel and Accommodations
Ithaca College maintains a [list of local hotels](https://www.ithaca.edu/orientation/family-and-supporter-resources/area-lodging).

For the funky boutique hotel experience, we recommend the [Argos Inn](https://www.argosinn.com/) (great Jazz nights) and the [William Henry Miller Inn](https://millerinn.com/) which are both downtown close to cultural center of downtown Ithaca.

[AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/ithaca-ny/stays)/[VRBO](https://www.vrbo.com/vacation-rentals/usa/new-york/finger-lakes/cayuga-lake/ithaca) also have many great options.

Parking on campus is free on Saturdays but there will be an admissions event during NEMISIG. However, there should be plenty of parking. Lot O near the Park School of Communications is close to Williams Hall and will likely be your best bet.
